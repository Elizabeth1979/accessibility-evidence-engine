# Changelog

All notable changes to Accessibility Evidence Engine are documented here. The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) while its public APIs remain experimental.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A learner-controlled before-and-after slideshow for icon naming, heading structure, and modal focus, backed by published scanner output and paired AEE reports.
- A focus-management judge that verifies explicit focus transfer into an opened dialog.
- `@aee/ai-fixes`, with an injectable contextual-label provider and an optional OpenAI Responses adapter using strict structured output.
- Deterministic-first AI review routing for semantic heading structure, icon-only labels, and decorative-versus-informative classification; routine findings cannot invoke the label provider.
- Static contextual-review images, including a real passing axe heading artifact and a separate reviewed full-page outline proposal.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Evidence collection around Playwright interactions for DOM, accessibility-tree, focus, screenshot, and network state.
- Keyboard, change-response, structure-evidence, and release-policy judges.
- JSON Schema validation, JSON and Markdown reports, a fixture CLI, and seven installable workspace packages.
- Privacy redaction for captured network data, including custom adapters.
- Public documentation, contribution guidance, security reporting, continuous integration, package verification, linting, formatting, coverage thresholds, CodeQL, and Dependabot configuration.
- An accessible public demonstration deployed with GitHub Pages.

### Security

- Network event fields are reconstructed from validated primitive types before persistence.
- Caller-provided run identifiers are restricted so they cannot escape the configured output directory.
- Nested CLI policy values are validated before execution.
